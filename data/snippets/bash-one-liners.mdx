#### Find & Execute

```bash
find /path/to/source -iname "*.jpg" -not -name ".*" -exec cp -nv {} /path/to/destination \;
```

#### Duplicate all directories of the same name

```bash
find $1 -type d -name ORIGINAL -exec bash -c 'cp -av $1 $(dirname $1)/RENAME' _ {} \;
```

This looks for all directories named ORIGINAL, then clones them into the same directory they
exist in, naming the copy RENAME.


#### Copy all DOCUMENTATION folders to new location using SHOOTDAY folder name

```bash
find SOURCE_DIR -type d -iname '*DOCUMENTATION*' -exec bash -c 'SD=$(echo $1 | grep -Eoi "\d\w*_SHOOTDAY_\w*\d"); cp -R $1 DESTINATION/$SD' _ {} \;```
```

This looks for all directories with DOCUMENTATION in the name, tries to extract the shootday name from the path and then clones to a specified destination, using the shootday as the name.
