#### file.py - with comments

```python
class File():

  file_count = 0 # This is a class attribute, it is applied to the class, not an instance.

  # Constructor. Runs on initialisation. Default values included.

    self.create_time
    self.__access_key # Two _'s defines it as a private attribute which can only be accessed externally through syntax: myFile._File__access_key

  # Sets a custom return string when an instance itself is printed, ie: print(myFile)
  def __str__(self):
    return f'File: {self.filename} - Size: {self.size}'

  # A instance method - it must use 'self' as the first parameter.
  def summarise(self):
    return f'This file has the name: {self.filename} and is {self.size}. It was created at {self.create_time}'

  # two __'s in method name makes it private, for use by other methods in the class only.
  def __private_method(self):
    print("I'm doing something private!")

  # Properties can be used to return read-only versions of a private attribute (ie, a getter)
  @property

    return self.__access.key

  # A setter method is used to allow updating a private attribute, extra protection logic can be added

      print("Access key can't be blank")
    else:
      self.__access_key = new_access_key
      print("Access key updated!")
