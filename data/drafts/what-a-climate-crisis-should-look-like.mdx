In May 2019, the UK Parliament declared a [climate emergency](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48126677/), just after the [UN had announced](https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/ga12131.doc.htm) that we have just 11 years to act to prevent irreversal catastrophic damage to our planet and its ecosystem.
So why then, two year later, doesn't it feel like we're in one?

In a rare moment of shared global suffering through the COVID-19 pandemic, now is an opportunity to reflect on what we've learnt about responding to such large, widespread global crisis, and see just how woeful our efforts to act on climate have been thus far.

Below I want to share what I believe are the absolute minimum set of actions that we should expect in a true climate crisis based on:
- My readings of others much more knowledgable than I - from climate scientists to historians and activists.
- The global response to COVID-19.
- Actions that are effective based on historical evidence.


### But first... Is this a crisis?
Yes! But we're doing such a bad job of treating it as such that _*still*_ many people simply don't acknowledge that we're in one. Here's some facts to base our 'crisis' status on:
- 


## The Media
The press and broadcast media are amongst the most important tools in society for forming public opinion and educating people. Their role in a crisis is piviotal.

- All forms of daily news sources (print and broadcast) should include a section dedicated to the crisis. Every day, no exception. It can and probably should be brief, but it should include the latest statistics, science and news. Everyone should know and understand CO2 equivilent ppm - what are current global level is, and what we have to get to (spoiler: we're at 419 and rising. It must get down to 350ppm). During the pandemic, we not only have had daily news sections dedicated to COVID-19 just as described above, but even daily government press briefings.
- Online news outlets should have a dedicated section on the climate crisis, right alongside sections such as Entertainment, Sport and Politics.

The BBC have done this for the COVID-19 pandemic, so why not the climate crisis?
- Hold governments to account on their performance in tackling the crisis, much like many have stepped up to do during the pandemic. We mustn't settle for less than considerable, demonstratable action.


## Government
Government intervention isn't often popular, but it is utterly unavoidable at this stage in a crisis. The government should, at a minimum:

- Immediately diversify all public investment in fossil fuel based or related funds.
- Establish citizens assemblies and actively include them in discussions and policy making.
- Divert all subsidies & financial support for high emission industries to greener solutions. A clear and simple example here is aviation & international travel. If companies such as Ryanair can offer sub Â£50 tickets to European destinations they do not need subsidies. Meanwhile Eurostar tickets to the same destinations cost considerably more. The UK's decision, for example, to [cut passenger duty fees on domestic flights](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/10/uk-set-to-cut-air-passenger-duty-on-domestic-flights) after pandemic is not appropiate during a climate crisis.
- Provide generous pubicly-backed financial support for private individuals and businesses alike to invest in green energy (solar, heat pumps, batteries) and transport (electric bikes and vehicles).
- Provide foreign aid to LEDCs who will unjustly suffer the most from a crisis they have contributed to the least.

## The public
There's no harder sell than trying to convince people they need to change their standard of living, way of life or culture, but during the COVID-19 pandemic we have proved it can be done. More than the vast majority have sacrified so much of their freedoms and embraced wearing face masks in the wake of an emergency.

When [just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of all emissions](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change) and [the richest 1% produce double the GHG emissions of the poorest 50%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-56723560) the crisis certainly does not land at the feet of the average person, but it does need their help to solve it.
